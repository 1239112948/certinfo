This directory contains configuration files and scripts to create custom
certificates that are useful for testing. They assume you have OpenSSL
and a bash-like shell.

make-certs.sh creates certificates from existing key files and OpenSSL
configuration files. This is useful, for example, if you want to test a new
extension but don't want to change the keys and dates of the certificates.

new-keys.sh generates new key files. This should not be useful and is included
only for reproducibility.
